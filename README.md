# Reinforcement Learning for Walking in Humanoids

#### Abstract :

Humanoid walking serves as an important challenge in the field of Robotics. This report presents the design and learning architecture for an omnidirectional walk used by a humanoid robot soccer agent acting in the RoboCup 3D simulation environment. The work explains the implementation of **Reinforcement learning** for improving the speed and stability of humanoid walking. Parameter optimization to achieve the above task was done using **CMA-ES algorithm** which acts a black box.
